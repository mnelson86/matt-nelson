                      <span class="card-title">About Me</span>
                      <p>I'm currently a Retail Salesperson at Hope Ace Hardware and Plumbing in Colchester, CT and enrolled in the FullStack Development Boot Camp from UConn. I have a Bachelor's of Science in Animal Science from UConn, and an Associate's in Liberal Arts and Sciences from Three Rivers Community College.</p>
                        <p>I consider myself to be well-rounded. My skills and interests are diverse because I think that every aspect of the world is worth exploring. I love adding new skills and knowledge to my ever-growing collection and becoming a more complete person because of it.</p>

                    <span class="card-title">Personal Interests</span>
                    <h5>My hobbies</h5>
                    <p>When I'm not working, I can often be found going on hikes or bike rides; riding or taking care of my horse; woodworking; reading fantasy novels; or just being at home and watching YouTube videos that teach me more about subjects I'm interested in.</p>
                    <h5>What I'm Currently Into</h5>
                    <p> I love storytelling and things that allow me to envision what it's like to be another person, to "walk a mile in their shoes". I love learning new things of all varieties and I love the ide of magic. That's actually something that's drawing me to programming and web development. In a very real sense, writing a computer program is an act of magic. All of these are my personal recommendations and things that I think epitomize those ideas:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li class= "underlined"><i class="material-icons">book</i>  Favorite book series: The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher</li>
                          <p>Currently 16 books long and an incredibly rich, lore-filled entertaining world with lifelike, likeable characters and outstanding action and power escalation.</p>
                        <li class= "underlined"><i class="material-icons">computer</i>  Youtube Channel I like: Linus Tech Tips</li>
                          <p> I want to build my own PC, and this channel has great advice, tips, and builds. It's also fun to see how enthusiastic they are about what they get to work with.</p>                        
                        <li class= "underlined"><i class="material-icons">play_arrow</i>  Podcast: The Adventure Zone</li>
                          <p>A real-play Dungeons and Dragons Podcast performed by the McElroy brothers and their father Clint. It starts off as a silly podcast of poeple who haven't played DnD, but becomes incredibly thoughtful, fun and heartwarming/heartbreaking.</p>
